Waf 1.6
-------

General

- MAKEFLAGS?
- recurse: from top or from current folder?
- check if Utils.subst_vars has the null value bug
- some configuration tests are for c only
- clean the files properly (waf clean)
- restrict waf step to the exact file (.c <-> .c.o)

- fake local libraries? relink when they change?
- broken conf.check_cfg and problems with default uselib (capital letters)
- better apis for shell compilation in Task.py + consistency with Utils.subst_vars
- refactor the environment thing ?

Low priority

- refactor the c and d preprocessor functions
- detect potential deadlocks in the task scheduler
- detect user typos (the checks have been removed)
- enable a Vigor-like mode to print suggestions (i.e. no task generators => print warnings, no build dir => print warnings)

Potential sub-projects (contributions will be welcome)

+ IDE file generator (msvc, codeblocks)
+ CMake file interpreter
+ multiprocess for distributed compilation (vs threads?)
+ autoconf-like configuration library?
+ rewrite the boost detection (boost.py)

diagram for the command workflow

- string expansion on other attributes
- compile targets at the end
- set CC and LINK to a particular variable (the wine example)


- show a complete example of c compilation with rules vs task generator code (procedural vs object-oriented)
