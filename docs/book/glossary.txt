Task generator::
	A task generator is an object instance of the class Task.task_gen. The task generators encapsulate the creation of various task instances at a time, and simplify the creation of ordering constraints between them (for example, compilation tasks are executed before link tasks).
Task::
	A Waf task is an object instance of the class Task.TaskBase. Waf tasks may be simple (Task.TaskBase) or related to the filesystem (Task.Task). Tasks represent the production of something during the build (files in general), and may be executed in sequence (with ordering constraints) or in parallel.
Waf tool::
	A Waf tool is a python module containing Waf-specific extensions. The Waf tools are located in the folder `waflib/Tools/` and usually contain a global variable 'configure' which may reference functions to execute in the configuration.
Node::
	The Node class is a data structure used to represent the filesystem in an efficient manner. The node objects may represent source files, folders, or build files. Non-directory nodes may associated to signatures containing the source file hash for source nodes or the task signature that produced the node.
