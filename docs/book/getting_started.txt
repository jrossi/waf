== Download and setup

=== Obtaining the Waf file

The Waf project is located on http://code.google.com/p/waf[Google Code].
The current Waf version requires an interpreter for the Python programming language such as http://www.python.org[cPython] 2.3 to 3.1 or http://www.jython.org[Jython] >= 2.5. Note that Waf requires http://docs.python.org/library/bz2.html[bzip2] compression support, which may be unavailable in self-compiled cPython installations.

==== Downloading and using the Waf binary

The Waf binary is a python script which does not require any installation whatsoever. It may be executed directly from a writeable folder. Just rename it as +waf+ if necessary:

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ wget http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.6.0
$ chmod 755 waf-1.6.0
$ mv waf-1.6.0 waf
$ ./waf --version
waf 1.6.0 (8840M)
---------------

The +waf+ file has its own library compressed in a binary stream in the same file. Upon execution, the library is uncompressed in a hidden folder in the current directory. The folder will be re-created if removed. This scheme enables different Waf versions to be executed from the same folders:

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ ls -ld .waf*
.waf-1.6.0-2c924e3f453eb715218b9cc852291170
---------------

NOTE: The binary file requires http://docs.python.org/library/bz2.html[bzip2] compression support, which may be unavailable in some self-compiled cPython installations.

==== Building Waf from the source code

Building Waf requires a Python interpreter having a version number in the range 2.6-3.1. The source code is then processed to support Python 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ wget http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.6.0.tar.bz2
$ tar xjvf waf-1.6.0.tar.bz2
$ cd waf-1.6.0
$ ./waf-light

=== Running waf

==== Local directory and permissions

Because the waf script is a python script, it may be used by calling +python+ on it.

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ python waf
---------------

Yet, it is usually convenient to set the executable permissions once (unix-like systems only):

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ chmod 755 waf
$ ./waf
---------------

The +waf+ script can be used directly from a writeable folder:

Or, if the executable permissions are not set:

The +waf+ file has its own library compressed in a binary stream in the same file. Upon execution, the library is uncompressed in the current directory, in a hidden folder that will be re-created if removed. The naming enables different Waf versions to be executed from the same folders:

==== The Waf directory



==== Portability concerns

By default, the recommended Python interpreter is cPython, for which the supported versions are 2.3 to 3.1. For maximum convenience for the user, a copy of the http://www.jython.org[Jython] interpreter in the version 2.5 may be redistributed along with a copy of the Waf executable.

NOTE: A project containing 'waf', 'jython2.5.jar' and the source code may be used almost anywhere.

WARNING: The 'waf' script must reside in a writable folder to unpack its cache files.
